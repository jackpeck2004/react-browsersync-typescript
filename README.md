# React Browsersync Typescript Template

This is a template built based on the repo here: https://github.com/gopinav/React-TypeScript-Webpack-Starter

Compared to the original this template has the addition of browsersyc which comes in very handy when developing.

It is an alternative to CRA but it is not meant to replace it in any way. Furthermore, this template does not include any advantages such as SSR or SSG which other frameworks such as Next and Gatsby do.
